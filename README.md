Ultimately, it should be integrated with early-vision-toolbox, as a module in it.

To try it out, first install all dependencies as required by early-vision-toolbox (without the Caffe part). Since spams-python is a great Python 2 only package, we still need to stay in Python 2. But we should make as much of the code Python 3 compatible as possible.
